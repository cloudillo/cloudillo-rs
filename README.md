Cloudillo - A decentralized collaboration application platform for privacy-focused users
========================================================================================

**Your Data, Your Rules**

What is Cloudillo and Why Does It Exist?
----------------------------------------

Online collaboration platforms typically fall into two categories:

1. **Cloud-based services:** Convenient but may raise concerns about privacy, bias, ads, and censorship.
2. **Self-hosted applications:** Provide flexibility but challenging to set up and don't integrate well with each other.

Cloudillo aims to bridge this gap by offering a self-hosted platform that connects users with the convenience of cloud services without sacrificing privacy and control over data.
